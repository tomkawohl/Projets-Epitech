    Example : CHEST:YES
              EVENT_2:NO
  - In map_current: Write CURRENT:NO (When game start, all files in map_current are like this, datas goes into during the game
    and when game is exited, it reset all currents maps date to write CURRENT:NO)

ADD new files to macro of src/struct.h.
It then will search automaticaly in map_init.
