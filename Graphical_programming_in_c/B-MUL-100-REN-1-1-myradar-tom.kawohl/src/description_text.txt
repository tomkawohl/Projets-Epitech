Air traffic simulation panel

USAGE
 ./my_radar [OPTIONS] 
 ./my_radar path_to_script
  path_to_script    The path to the script file.

PATH_TO_SCRIPT RULES
  The path to the script file must be valid
  
  To add a plane in your script, add in order and on one line:
  - The letter ‘A’
  - Two integers corresponding to the departure x and y coordinates
  - Two integers corresponding to the arrival x and y coordinates
  - One integer corresponding to the aircraft’s speed (in pixels per second)
  - One integer corresponding to the delay (in seconds) before the aircraft takes off

  To add a tower in your script, add in order and on one line:
  - The letter ‘T’
  - Two integers corresponding to the control tower x- and y-coordinates
  - One integer corresponding to the radius of the tower’s control area (corresponding to the percentage
  of the greatest side of the window in pixel)

OPTIONS
 -h    print the usage and quit.
 -d    debug mode to test collisions (hitbox's object become red if collisions are detected)

USER INTERACTIONS
 'L' key    enable/disable hitboxes and areas.
 'S' key    enable/disable sprites.

DEBUG USER INTERACTIONS
  'arrow' keys  to move the plane
  'R'     key   to rotate plane

END CONDITIONS:
If every planes are crashed or landed, the simulation ends

In bonus_hitbox's folder:
A new my_radar where you can choose airplanes's hitbox in your script.
You can execute my_radar -h in bonus_hitbox's folder for more precision.
