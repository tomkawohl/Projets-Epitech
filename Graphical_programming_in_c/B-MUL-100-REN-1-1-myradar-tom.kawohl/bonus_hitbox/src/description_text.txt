USAGE
 ./my_radar [OPTIONS]
 ./my_radar path_to_script

PATH_TO_SCRIPT RULES
  The path to the script file must be valid
  
  To add a plane in your script, add in order and on one line:
  - The letter ‘A’
  - Two integers corresponding to the departure x and y coordinates
  - Two integers corresponding to the arrival x and y coordinates
  - One integer corresponding to the aircraft’s speed (in pixels per second)
  - One integer corresponding to the delay (in seconds) before the aircraft takes off
  - Two integers corresponding to the hitbox, width and height

  To add a tower in your script, add in order and on one line:
  - The letter ‘T’
  - Two integers corresponding to the control tower x- and y-coordinates
  - One integer corresponding to the radius of the tower’s control area (corresponding to the percentage
  of the greatest side of the window in pixel)

  an exemple of a valid script named exemple.txt is at your disposal 

OPTIONS
 -h    print the usage and quit.

 'S' key    enable/disable sprites.
